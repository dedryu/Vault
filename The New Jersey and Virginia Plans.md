[[American Politics and the US Constitution (MOC)]]
## Introduction
In the previous lessons, you reviewed the structure, powers, and main weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. In this lesson, you will review the competing ideologies and ideas for how to address the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation in the Constitution.

Have you ever wondered why Congress has two different chambers instead of one? Have you ever thought that maybe, if the U.S. only had one chamber or even fewer people in Congress, laws and policies could be passed more quickly with less gridlock? The structure of Congress today exists because of the Great Compromise that occurred during the Constitutional Convention, when debates over the best way to represent states in the national legislature occurred. The purpose of this lesson is to help you understand the competing ideologies during the Constitutional Convention and the resulting proposed plan for state representation in the legislative branch.

## The Question of Representation - Small States versus Large States
Fifty-five delegates arrived in Philadelphia in May of 1787 for the [[Constitutional Convention]]. Many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared the consequences of creating a government that was too powerful.

The delegates wished to preserve state independence, although not to a degree that prevented the states from working together or that made them entirely independent of the will of the national government. While seeking to protect the rights of individuals from government abuse, they still wished to create a society in which law and order was not sacrificed at the demands for individual liberty.   
  
Delegates from small states like [[New Jersey]] did not want their interests ignored by delegates from more populous states like Virginia. In addition, everyone was concerned about slavery. Representatives from southern states worried that delegates from states where slavery had been, or was being, abolished might try to outlaw it. Others feared that Southerners might attempt to make slavery a permanent part of American society.

One of the first differences to become clear among the delegates was state size, between those from large states such as New York and Virginia and those from small states like Delaware. When discussing the structure of the government under the new Constitution, the delegates from [[Virginia]] wanted a **bicameral legislature** consisting of two chambers. The number of state representatives in each chamber was to be based on each state's population. In each state, representatives in the **lower chamber** would be elected by **popular vote.** These representatives would then select their state's representatives in the **upper chamber** from among candidates proposed by the state's legislature. Once a representative's term in the legislature had ended, the representative could not be reelected until an unspecified amount of time had passed. This plan became known as the [[Virginia Plan]].

Delegates from small states objected to the Virginia Plan. Another proposal, known as the [[New Jersey Plan]], required a **unicameral legislature** with one chamber, in which each state would have one vote. Thus, smaller states would have the same power in the national legislature as larger states. However, the larger states argued that because they had more residents, they should be allowed more legislators to represent their interests.

## Federal Supremacy versus State Sovereignty
Perhaps the greatest division among the states split those who favored a strong national government and those who favored limiting its powers and allowing states to govern themselves in most matters.

Supporters of a strong central government argued that it was necessary for the survival and efficient functioning of the new nation.
- Without the authority to maintain and command an army and navy, the nation could not defend itself at a time when European powers still maintained formidable empires in North America.
- Without the power to tax and regulate trade, the government would not have enough money to maintain the nation's defense, protect American farmers and manufacturers from foreign competition, create the infrastructure necessary for interstate commerce and communications, maintain foreign embassies, or pay federal judges and other government officials.
- Other countries would be reluctant to loan money to the United States if the federal government lacked the ability to impose taxes to repay its debts.

Besides giving more power to populous states, the Virginia Plan also favored a strong national government that would legislate for the states in many areas and would have the power to veto laws passed by state legislatures.

Others, however, feared that a strong national government might become too powerful and deprive citizens of their rights. They advocated for a central government with sufficient authority to defend the nation but insisted that other powers be left to the states, which were believed to be better able to understand and protect the needs and interests of their residents.

Such delegates approved the approach of the New Jersey Plan, which retained the unicameral Congress that had existed under the Articles of Confederation. It gave additional power to the national government, such as the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and to force states to comply with laws passed by Congress.

However, states still retained a lot of power, including power over the national government. Congress, for example, could not impose taxes without the consent of the states. Furthermore, the nation's chief executive, appointed by Congress, could be removed by Congress if state governors demanded it.

- **Virginia Plan:** a plan proposed by the representatives of Virginia at the Constitutional Convention for a two-house (i.e., bicameral) legislature, wherein the number of a state's representatives in each chamber would be based on that state's population
- **New Jersey Plan:** a plan proposed by the representatives of New Jersey at the Constitutional Convention that required a one-house national legislature in which each state would have one vote
- **unicameral legislature:** a lawmaking body in the legislative branch that consists of only one chamber, like the New Jersey Plan; uni, meaning "one," and camera, meaning "chamber," are Latin
- **lower chamber:** the larger of the two chambers in a bicameral legislature; in the United States, this is the House of Representatives
