[[American Politics and the US Constitution (MOC)]]
## Introduction
One of the greatest influences on American government and politics is ideas that emerged during the period of history known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The Enlightenment happened in Western Europe from approximately 1650 to 1800. It was a time that redefined human existence by changing the political and religious power of the Middle Ages to an existence more compatible with human individuality and liberty. From the Enlightenment came the American beliefs about individualism, equality, liberty, rights of property, and freedom of religion.

The Enlightenment also led to government by consent, representative democracy, and constitutionalism. In fact, these ideas became central to the creation of an American political identity. In this module, you will come to understand American government and politics by first gaining an awareness of the ideas of the Enlightenment.

## The Enlightenment in a Nutshell
Of all the Enlightenment thinkers, [[John Locke]] is the most influential. The most significant contributions of Locke, a 17th century English philosopher, are his ideas regarding the relationship between government and **natural rights**, said to be the God-given rights to life, liberty, and property.  
  
In his *[[Two Treatises of Government (1689)]]*, Locke rejected the idea of the divine right of kings, defined what it means to be human, and specified the proper structure for civil society.

Locke expressed that humans are autonomous, independent individuals, capable of using reason, and driven to advance their personal interests. Humans' most important interest is survival. To achieve this security and comfort, humans acquire property.  
  
Locke identified two key aspects to human existence. The first is liberty, which is a product of independence. The second is property, which is used to maintain that independence. Because these two things are necessary to human existence, they are called natural rights. "Natural" refers to the fact that these are a part of human existence. "Rights" means that humans are free to use them without needing the permission of others. So, natural rights allow people to do what they need to survive and be secure, and these rights provide equality among all people.  
  
As all humans share the same natural rights, they also share an equality of being, all equally entitled to liberty and property. With this in mind, Locke turned people's attention to the creation of civil society. The **state of nature**, said Locke, is inconvenient. It is not a terrible place to be, but things could be better. One way to make things better would be to cooperate with others. By being a member of a group, a person can improve their security and comfort. Since this is something humans naturally want to do, it makes sense for people to form a society. 
  
However, this society will have to have certain characteristics. First, it will have to respect humans' liberty. While this liberty may no longer be absolute (people will need to make some sacrifices to join with others), people will still get to keep as much liberty as possible. Second, humans' interest in property also needs to be respected. Consistent with maximum liberty, people should also have maximum rights to property.

## Society
Society will only have minimum authority necessary to regulate humans' co-existence. Furthermore, government, which is created by society to make and enforce rules, is also limited in authority it can exert over people.

Note that both society and government require the consent of the people. Without this consent, both would be illegitimate. And as human consent is required for the creation of societies and governments, it stands to reason that people also hold the power for societal and governmental destruction.

Locke also cautioned in *[[A Letter Concerning Toleration (1689)]]* that if humans want to be free to pursue their own interests, they must be willing to let others pursue their own interests. People must be tolerant of each other's differences. While Locke's main concern was for religious tolerance, his general idea can be extended to all the things done by individuals in a society.

[[Montesquieu]]'s contribution in *[[The Spirit of the Laws (1748)]]* regards the structure of political institutions. He argues for a separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Each will serve as a check on the power of the other, limiting the harm each might do.

Montesquieu separates power to offset the power of different social interests: ordinary people, the aristocracy, and the monarch. The first two make up the separate **chambers** in the legislative branch while the third makes up the executive. Each power can check the activity of the others. The judicial branch exists to ensure that the law is fairly applied, thus checking the legislative and executive branches. In this, Montesquieu balanced the natural animosities he saw in society, preventing anyone from using government to their sole advantage.

Montesquieu also advocates for **due process**. Due process involves the government's obligation to treat all citizens fairly. This requirement lessens the extent to which government power can be exerted over the individual, making the power difference between the two fairer, and ensuring a general sense of political equality.

Lastly, [[Adam Smith]], in *[[Wealth of Nations (1776)]]*, gives definition to humans' economic lives. Playing off the ideas of property introduced by Locke, Smith went a step further and argued not only for a strong expression of property rights but also for minimal government regulation of the economic marketplace. According to Smith, people's freedom to pursue their own economic interests without interference maximizes the wealth that can be created through economic activity. Wealth that is created because of this unrestricted economic activity will have a general positive impact for society.
