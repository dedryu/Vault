[[American Politics and the US Constitution (MOC)]]
## Introduction
In this lesson, you will review the major debates and compromises that happened during the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The purpose of the Constitutional Convention was to address the issues and weaknesses created by the Articles of Confederation. By 1786, it was clear that the Articles of Confederation were not working for the newly formed United States of America.

## From Convention to Ratification
[[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] invited delegates from the other 11 states to meet in Annapolis, Maryland, for the purpose of revising the [[Articles of Confederation]]. However, only five states sent representatives. Because all 13 states had to agree to any changes to the Articles, the convention in Annapolis could not accomplish its goal. Two of the delegates, [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], requested that all states send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia the following year to once again attempt to revise the Articles of Confederation. All the states except [[Rhode Island]] chose delegates to send to the meetingâ€”resulting in a total of 70 men.

Because the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation proved impossible to overcome, the convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787 decided to create an entirely new government. To create this new government, compromises were necessary, as no one could get exactly everything they wanted. These compromises included the following:  
- changes in the structure of the legislative branch and how representation would be determined for each state
- the necessary powers for the branches of government
- the balance of power between the national government and state governments, which, under the Articles of Confederation, tilted heavily toward the individual states

After reviewing the various compromises that happened during the [[Constitutional Convention]], you will be able to further describe the influence of competing political ideologies on the development of the United States government.
