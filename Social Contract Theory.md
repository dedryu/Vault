## The Social Contract
One of the more interesting ideas to emerge during the **Enlightenment** is that of the **social contract.** Up to this point, it was understood that society was either a natural product of human existence or the creation of God. In both cases, a person's societal membership is assumed, as well as obligations they are expected to accept for their roles in society. Because society is either natural or created, it's something that must be accepted for what it is. Humans are committed to a particular definition of society and their roles, whether they like it or not.

One of the first individuals to contribute to the idea of the **social contract theory** was a pre-Enlightenment English philosopher, [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679). In *[[Leviathan (1651)]]*, Hobbes argues that society isn't something natural and inflexible. Instead, it's something created by humans to resolve problems they face in an effort to make their lives better.
  
Instead of being passive members of society, humans are its creators, and the society humans create has purpose of serving their needs. This puts people in control of society, rather than society being in control of people. From this simple understanding, people come to realize that they can create whatever type of society they want. As long as society remains true to its purpose of serving human needs, any form of government a society has will work.   
  
As a safeguard from corruption, democratic governments are preferable. First, a small number of people are more easily corrupted, like in a monarchy, than a larger number of people. Second, because the people retain a direct role in the process of a democratic government, they are more likely to hold the government accountable. **Direct democracy**, however, requires too much of a sacrifice from people's private lives to manage their public existence. A representative democracy, which lies at the heart of modern democratic government, is the best solution. Only a subset of the population is required to manage public affairs, leaving the rest of the population to focus on their own lives.  
  
There is more to a social contract than this. It also must recognize human nature and natural rights. A contract is often constructed to be compatible with human nature and to protect natural rights. Therefore, a social contract offers insights into how people, both as a group and individually, perceive their social, economic, and political existence.  
  
However, social contracts can be flawed, as they are built on consensus (i.e., everyone in agreement). For a social contract to work, it must reflect who people are and what they want to do. This implies humans all have the same abilities and purposes. When a social contract is imposed in situations where people do not have the same abilities and purposes, conflicts can arise. In a democratic society, these conflicts are managed through the political process. Democratic politics, therefore, are not always peaceful.

## The State of Nature and Natural Rights
While [[John Locke]] and Hobbes both have different takes on social contracts, they share a basic starting point: the **state of nature**. The state of nature is an acknowledged fiction; each of these authors knows it is not real. However, assuming it does exist makes human existence easier to understand.

The state of nature is a condition in which humans live individually and solitarily prior to existence of society. Humans are physically and mentally capable of surviving on their own. This ideal state allows the authors to define what human nature is and what rights human beings possess. The state of nature defines what it means to be human and what natural rights should be protected, so it's an important part of creating a social contract.  
  
Some of the rights humans possess are called natural rights, or basic human rights. These important rights are central to survival. People decide how they will live their individual lives. For instance, humans need food, clothing, and shelter to survive. These would be natural rights, and society cannot (or should not) interfere with humans' efforts to obtain them. People may also choose to believe in a god. This belief defines human existence; therefore, it is important in how humans define themselves as individuals. Natural rights are vital for the protection of a person's individual existence and the definition of their individual identity.  
  
When social contracts are designed, natural rights are an important part of that contract's construction.
  
What, then, is lifelike in the state of nature? It depends on who you ask. Hobbes says that life is "a war of all against all." Basically, the state of nature is a pretty hostile place where lives are always at risk.  
  
Locke, in the [[Two Treatises of Government (1689)]], disagrees, saying the state of nature is a peaceful place. All its inhabitants are rational people, mindful of the basic law of nature not to harm one another, and people will get along okay. But he believes that humans' relationship with the state of nature is "inconvenient," implying an incentive for people to devise a better, more convenient arrangement through a society with limited authority over its citizens.  
  
Each author specifies a different state of nature as well as a different type of social contract. Hobbes seeks out physical security. Because humans pose very real threats to each other, they need someone to impose order—preferably a monarch. Yes, life under such a monarch might be brutal, but it is better than being dead. The natural right that Hobbes's social contract protects is the right to life.  
  
According to Locke, life is not the key consideration, but the quality of life is. Locke's social contract seeks to provide basic protection from harm, while simultaneously permitting individuals to pursue their own lives as they see fit. Locke adds that liberty and property are the most important natural rights to be protected.

It is important to know what the quality of life is when creating a social contract. It explains the incentive for working cooperatively with others. It also helps to frame the type of social contract that is needed to make individual lives better.

## Social Contract and Consensual Political Rule
While social contracts are an interesting way to organize society, they pose a problem. Social contracts are based on consensus, meaning people are all in agreement. This implies a high degree of sameness among individuals.   
  
The natural rights of some are denied for the benefit of others, and inequality results. Inequality eventually leads to social and political conflict. If this conflict is severe enough, it can result in a breakdown of social and political life. Perhaps the most prominent example of a breakdown of the American social contract was the [[American Civil War]] (1860–1865).  
  
Fortunately, democratic politics permit an ongoing renegotiation of the social contract, which can lead to a new consensus. The American political system is well equipped for this, with its frequent elections introducing new interests into the political process on an ongoing basis.   
  
However, that does not mean the social contract is not seriously challenged. The Civil War is only one example of a major political movement in the United States. Others include:  
- the labor movement
- women's suffrage
- the civil rights movement
- the women's liberation movement
  
Currently, questions about the American social contract can be heard from both sides of the **political spectrum**. The [[TEA Party movement]] (from 2009 to the present) is a reaction by conservatives over their belief that the American social contract has become too liberal. Members have come out against government interference and a deterioration of moral standards. This movement has played a significant role in present-day [[Republican Party]] politics and, in part, helped elect [[Donald Trump]] as president.   

On the left side of the political spectrum, liberals have a new civil rights movement. Important parts of this movement seek to correct the inequalities seen to exist that deny minority groups, such as LGBTQ+ persons, their rights under the Constitution. The Occupy Wall Street movement (2011–present) advocates for the correction of today's economic inequalities. The Black Lives Matter movement (2013–present) advocates for those who feel racial minorities are harshly and unjustly treated by people of authority—in particular, by law enforcement.  
  
Something that connects these right-wing and left-wing movements is a softening (and sometimes a rejection) of a commitment to the American social contract. Protesters on the right side of the political spectrum argue that they are free to ignore the law in favor of their natural rights. This occurred when Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, refused to issue a marriage license to a gay couple. On the left side of the political spectrum, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and Philadelphia mayor James Kenney ignored a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for immigration information required by federal law.  
  
This process of revising the American social contract is ongoing, as it should be, given that societies change over time. The disagreements that emerge between those for the status quo and those seeking change are addressed through the American democratic process. It's not unusual then to see this process marked by conflict.
