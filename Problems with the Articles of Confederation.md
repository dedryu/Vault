[[American Politics and the US Constitution (MOC)]]

## Introduction
Now that you understand the powers of the national government under the Articles of Confederation, it is equally important to understand the powers that the national government did not possess. In discussing how the national government could not do much, you can more easily understand why the Articles of Confederation ultimately proved to be a weak document and one that would surely bring the newly formed United States to ruin if not corrected. Imagine if the United States Congress declared war against another country, but there were no soldiers to fight that war because none of the states allowed their soldiers to participate. What would that do to the reputation of the United States? Would it be considered a strong country or a weak country vulnerable to attacks?  
  
The Articles of Confederation satisfied the desires of those in the new nation who wanted a weak central government with limited power. Ironically, however, the Articles' success in establishing a weak central government also led to their undoing. It soon became apparent that, while they protected the sovereignty of the states, the Articles had created a central government too weak to function effectively. In this lesson, you will explore these weaknesses in greater detail.

## Power to Raise an Army or Navy
The national government lacked the power to raise an army or navy. Fears of a tyrannical government with unlimited use of an army had led the writers of the [[Articles of Confederation]] to leave defense mostly to the states. Although the central government could declare war and agree to peace, it had to depend upon the states to provide soldiers. If state governors chose not to provide those soldiers, the country would lack an adequate defense. This was quite dangerous at a time when England and Spain still controlled large portions of North America.

Remember that under the Articles of Confederation, the national government had the power to declare war. So, while the national government could appoint senior officials to the U.S. Army, this power was essentially useless because there was no national army.  
  
Under the Articles of Confederation, each state had its own militia (military), and anytime the national government wanted to declare war, it had to send a request to each of the states to send troops. The only thing the national government could do was make a request; ultimately, the states could choose if they wanted to send troops or not.  
  
The lack of a national army meant that the national government could not draft any soldiers into the military. This ultimately proved one of the greatest weaknesses of the national government, not only within the United States but also on an international scale. The United States was seen as a country incapable of defending itself against any outside threats. Large portions of what is now the United States were still occupied by other countries, such as England and Spain. The inability of the states to protect themselves created an international reputation of weakness for the United States.

## Regulating Trade
The national government did not possess the power to regulate trade among the different states. This lack of authority affected not only the national government but the states as well. The national economy suffered as foreign countries began to form trade agreements with individual states, agreements for which the national government could not regulate or tax.  
  
Due to the absence of regulation, the British government began to import massive amounts of untaxed goods (products) into the United States, offering drastically lower prices. These low prices meant the products produced in the United States were in competition with the lower-priced British goods, so it became difficult to sell American-made goods. This meant that local businesses suffered and struggled to make enough money to survive.  
  
If the national government had the ability to regulate commerce, it could have taxed British imported goods, keeping the prices of all goods consistent.

## Problems with the Articles of Confederation
The national government could not impose taxes on citizens. It could only request money from the states.

Requests for money were usually not honored. As a result, the national government was left underfunded and unable to pay for national defense or fulfill its other responsibilities. Also, foreign governments were reluctant to loan money to the U.S. for fear that it would not be able to repay those loans. The currency of the U.S. became worthless.

| The national government could not regulate foreign trade or interstate commerce. | The government could not prevent foreign countries from hurting American competitors by shipping inexpensive products to the United States. It could not prevent states from passing laws that interfered with domestic trade. As a result, many local farmers and business owners failed. |
| The national government could not raise an army. It had to request that the states send men. | State governments could choose not to honor Congress's request for troops. This would make it hard to defend the nation. |
| Each state had only one vote in Congress regardless of its size. | Populous states (states with larger populations) had disproportionate representation. |
| The Articles could not be changed without a unanimous vote to do so. | Problems with the Articles could not be easily fixed. |
| There was no national judicial system. | Judiciaries are important enforcers of national government power. |
 
The Articles of Confederation had many problems that could not be repaired. The biggest problem was the lack of power given to the national government. For example, the states under the Articles lacked the force to put down insurrections and civil violence. In fact, one reason for the calling of the Constitutional Convention was Shays' Rebellion in the autumn of 1786. Daniel Shays and his followers were debtors (farmers with low income) who planned to march on Boston to seek relief for their debts, and as the rebel farmers gathered weapons, the nation's political elites were unable to stop the rebellion. As a result of the ineffectiveness of the Articles of Confederation, the call to change the Articles became stronger.Â   
  
Another problem was the lingering power the British government continued to hold. For instance, it could form individual relationships with the states and refuse to accept U.S. currency to repay U.S. debts. The British government was also able to pressure states in the west through its occupation of the land bordering those states.
