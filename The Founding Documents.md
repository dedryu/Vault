[[American Politics and the US Constitution (MOC)]]

## Introduction
The impact of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] can be seen through the expression of its ideas in America's founding documents. In both obvious and subtle ways, the [[Declaration of Independence]], the [[Constitution]], and the [[Bill of Rights]] contain key Enlightenment ideas about the nature of democratic government and the institutional processes of government.

But those ideas are more subtle than a person might think. One could argue that the ideas expressed in the Declaration of Independence are consistent with [[John Locke]]'s. Then, as a result of post-Revolution experiences, a shift can be detected.   
  
The ideas of [[Montesquieu]] are more prominently expressed than Locke's in both the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. However, some of Locke's ideas manage to infiltrate the Bill of Rights, leaving a mixture of both philosophers' ideas in these documents.

Overall, the two basic sets of ideas in play here — Locke versus Montesquieu — are somewhat incompatible. They serve as the foundation for a disagreement over the nature of government, which is also reflected in the disagreements between the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists.  
  
This disagreement involved the ideas of liberty and majority rule. For liberty, how much should there be? For majority rule, to what extent should it be allowed? The Anti-Federalists wanted as much of both as possible, while the Federalists are more for restraints on both.

## The Declaration of Independence
The Declaration of Independence, written primarily by [[Thomas Jefferson]], expresses many of the ideas John Locke illustrated in [[Two Treatises of Government (1689)]]. Locke maintained that society is rational but voluntary. Government, which regulates the terms of the social contact, should protect people's natural rights and operate democratically. The most important natural rights are liberty and property.  
  
Remember Jefferson's words from the preamble of the Declaration:
> *"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."*
> - **Thomas Jefferson, Declaration of Independence, 1776**

This excerpt reflects the core of Locke's argument.  
  
When the United States was founded, it was committed to Lockean ideas. Subsequent efforts to create government, both nationally and on the state level, hold true to these ideals that seek to retain democratic control over government by keeping it close to the people. The rights to liberty and property are given considerable importance.  
  
A good example is found in the [[Articles of Confederation]], which was the first effort to organize the 13 new states into a working association. The Articles gave little authority to the national government, choosing instead to keep power with the states, where the people could better watch over it. The states were given a great deal of independence, since little of their **sovereignty** was sacrificed to this national effort. The people kept a considerable amount of control over government, which allowed their rights of liberty and property to be more fully respected.

## The United States Constitution
The Constitution also includes the less democratic ideas of Montesquieu. The framers of the Constitution—including [[James Madison]], [[George Washington]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]]—were concerned about the violence of the post-Revolutionary period. Events like [[Shays' Rebellion]] (1786–1787), which almost resulted in potential mob rule, suggested there might be too much democracy, and that maybe individual liberty was going too far. 

Concern for the security of property rights led to a reaction against some of the more democratic ideas associated with the [[American Revolutionary War]]. This basic idea can be seen in Madison’s defense of the Constitution in *[[Federalist No. 10]]*. Madison was in favor of the solution offered by Montesquieu, in his [[The Spirit of the Laws (1748)]]. 
  
Montesquieu argues for representative rather than popular rule and for the division of political power within government to lessen the impact of the popular will.
  
The Constitution incorporates Montesquieu's principles by separating the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, placing each into the hands of different political groups. Note how the first three articles divide the powers of government into these basic elements. Consistent with Montesquieu's effort to offset the power of factional (self-interested) elements in society, the Constitution establishes a **bicameral legislature**, with each chamber serving different social groups: the House of Representatives serves the people, and the Senate serves the states. The Constitution creates a chief executive (president) in a process that distances the nation's presidents from the popular will; a specially selected subset of voters called presidential electors chooses the president. State **legislatures**, not the people, select these electors. Overall, the Constitution serves to check factional power against factional power.  

Furthermore, given its special circumstances, the Constitution works to undermine the sovereignty of the states. The list of **enumerated rights** appearing in Article I gives Congress considerable power over activity that goes beyond state boundaries, including depriving states of any power in foreign affairs. 

The power granted to Congress is enhanced by the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], which allows Congress considerable authority in carrying out its enumerated powers. Unlike the Articles of Confederation, the power of the national government under the Constitution is increased as the power of the states decreases. This allows Montesquieu's checking of power to extend to yet another political level.  
  
Also consistent with Montesquieu, the Constitution is not too concerned about the protection of natural rights. Other than the most basic of protections from government, such as _**habeas corpus**_, the Constitution is mostly silent on natural rights. Perhaps the only positive protection is the banning of religious tests for office, which appears at the end of Article VI.  
  
As for liberty, it appears only in the Preamble, following a list of other priorities, including justice, domestic tranquility, the common defense, and the general welfare. In fact, in *[[Federalist No. 51]]*, Madison goes so far as to write:

> *"Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit."*
> - **James Madison, 1787**

This statement appears to contradict the Declaration of Independence, where the right of liberty, above all, is prized. Instead, Madison says liberty can be readily sacrificed in the pursuit of justice, which is in agreement with Montesquieu.

The Constitution is more interested in the practicalities of government than in the protection of natural rights. Thus, it reflected those ideas of the Enlightenment.

## The Bill of Rights
A backlash to the Constitution arose during the debate for **ratification**. Those who were committed to the ideas of the Declaration of Independence opposed ratification. They insisted on preserving the powers of local government, democratic control, and a strong protection of natural rights. Those in opposition were called the Anti-Federalists.

The power of the Anti-Federalists was strong enough during the debate to jeopardize the ratification of the Constitution. However, denial of the ratification was not certain, so the Anti-Federalists struck a bargain: withhold their opposition in favor of a certain statement of natural rights to be protected by a series of constitutional amendments. These amendments, which are the first 10 to the Constitution, are known as the Bill of Rights.

Overall, the Bill of Rights is a mix of Enlightenment ideas. The First Amendment gives a definitive declaration for the protection of natural rights:

> *"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."*
> - **First Amendment, Constitution of the United States, 1787**

The Bill of Rights amounts to protections of individual conscience as well as protections for democratic participation. These are Lockean ideas.

The Second Amendment, which also contains Lockean ideas, permits the possession of arms for the "security of a free State." The Second Amendment also includes the right to defend oneself against tyrannical government, which is another Lockean idea.

But the amendments eventually reflect Montesquieu's ideas. Montesquieu argued that due process is a vital feature for government. Due process says all citizens must receive fair and equitable treatment. The fourth through eighth amendments serve to both limit the power government has over U.S. citizens and establish procedures that the government must follow when dealing with citizens. These procedures are especially important for when a person is accused of committing a crime.

For example, in the Fourth Amendment, citizens' persons, houses, papers, and effects are protected against unreasonable searches and seizures. This is more Montesquieuian than Lockean because the protection is not complete. Searches and seizures can happen when a warrant has been issued. And the right to privacy, a liberty, can be violated if due process is followed.

Even the natural rights Jefferson included in the Declaration of Independence can be violated if due process is followed. The Fifth Amendment says people can be "deprived of life, liberty, or property," so long as the due process of law is followed. Interestingly, it's only when one's personal property is taken for public use, not their life or liberty, that they are entitled to fair compensation.

The Bill of Rights does finish with Lockean ideas. The Ninth Amendment makes it clear that the list of rights protected in the first eight amendments is not complete and that U.S. citizens can claim additional natural rights when they see fit (at least in theory). The 10th Amendment makes clear that powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states and the people. However, how such rights are to be divided between the states and the people is not made clear. The last two amendments leave the relationship between the people (and states) and the federal government open-ended. The inference, though, is that the people still retain considerable authority to modify this relationship.
