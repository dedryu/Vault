[[American Politics and the US Constitution (MOC)]]
## Making and Interpreting Laws
Congress is the national legislature; therefore, all laws must go through Congress. However, the process of making and interpreting laws is one that requires all three branches to work together. To begin, laws must be signed by the president in order to go into effect, providing a major check by the executive branch on Congress.

As a result, the president also has the power to veto legislation. Congress can override a veto if it repasses the law with a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.  
  
Laws passed by Congress may undergo judicial review by the judiciary. While Congress can pass any law and have it signed by the president, the courts can overturn it if they decide that the law violates the Constitution. The courts can also interpret laws in a way that ensures that they do not violate the Constitution. This can change the way that the laws are administered by the executive branch.

There is another check that is internal within Congress. The House of Representatives and the Senate represent the country differently. States with large urban areas and large populations have more influence in the House of Representatives, while states with small populations have more weight in the Senate—where each state has two senators. This difference means that laws passing through Congress must be accepted by each chamber where different groups have power. This arrangement reflects the fact that the Founding Fathers wanted the House of Representatives to represent the people and the Senate to represent the states and to provide balance between them.

## Foreign Policy and Nominations
### Foreign Policy
There are many checks and balances in foreign policy. The president or the president's people can negotiate treaties, but they must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. Such approval may be hard to get, as demonstrated by Woodrow Wilson's failure to have the Treaty of Versailles (establishing the League of Nations) approved by the Senate after World War I.  
  
Presidents, however, can sign executive agreements with foreign leaders. When Israel and Egypt signed their peace treaty at Camp David in 1978, President Carter signed an executive agreement with Prime Minister Begin of Israel and President Sadat of Egypt, providing support for each country and agreeing to have Americans monitor the provisions of the peace treaty.  
   
Executive agreements are not treaties. They are arrangements between the president and a foreign political leader and are only valid while the leaders in both countries remain in power. Congress can limit the effectiveness of such agreements if they require funding provided by Congress. The courts, through the power of judicial review, can make sure such agreements do not conflict with the Constitution or treaties. Since only Congress can declare war, this power limits the president's ability to use military force, even though as commander in chief, they can order troops into combat.

### Nominations
The president has a great deal of power in terms of nominating individuals to fill key posts in the judicial branch and the executive branch. The president nominates justices of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts. However, these nominations must also receive approval by the Senate. While the president and Senate control the nomination process, once appointed, justices and judges are protected from political pressure. Justices and judges serve during times of good behavior, ensuring that it will be difficult to pressure them to make a particular decision. Justices and judges can only be removed if a majority of the House of Representatives votes to impeach them and two-thirds of the Senate votes to remove them from power.  
  
The **impeachment** process provides a safeguard against individual members of the judiciary escaping the consequences of wrongdoing or being beyond the control of the other branches. The president also nominates individuals to posts in the executive branch, including ambassadors to foreign countries. Executive branch nominations must be approved by a majority vote in the Senate. While the Senate normally approves these nominations, it may occasionally block a nomination to indicate its opposition to certain policies or individuals. Most of the individuals appointed in this fashion can be dismissed by the president. Congress can also use the impeachment process to remove individuals if the president does not dismiss them.

## Executive Orders
As head of the executive branch, the president can direct agencies to administer laws in particular ways. A president can affect the administration of laws passed by Congress with **executive orders,** which have become part of the system of checks and balances. Executive orders can even be used in some cases when Congress has failed to act on legislation that the president desires.

President Truman used an executive order to integrate the armed forces. He was able to do so because no law required segregation of the armed forces. The armed forces had only been segregated by customary practice. President Obama used executive orders to influence immigration policies. President Trump in turn used executive orders to reverse some of President Obama's policies and to institute new ones.

Congress can refuse to provide funding for executive orders. While the Supreme Court has long accepted the use of executive orders, not every executive order is constitutional. Therefore, executive orders can also be challenged in the courts and can be declared unconstitutional. The executive orders relating to immigration by both President Obama and President Trump have been challenged in the courts, and some of these actions have been overturned. Executive orders remain an important tool that presidents can use to accomplish their goals and to overcome or ignore opposition in Congress.

## Budget and Other Checks
### Budget
Control of funding for activities is an important part of congressional power. Congress authorizes the spending of various activities and sets funding levels for the national government. In the early years, Congress also often passed a budget for the government.

With the passage of time, passage of a budget became more difficult, and in 1921, the president was given the task of preparing a budget every year. Whoever prepares the budget controls, to some extent, the nature of the debate over spending.

The budget process gives both the executive and legislative branches a role in government spending. Control over spending in other areas also gives Congress power. Congress can refuse to fund executive orders, executive agreements, or otherwise provide the necessary funds for the projects that presidents want to pursue.

### Other Checks
- Presidents who want to abuse the powers of the office must be aware of the impeachment process. Presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump were all impeached but survived the vote in the Senate. President Richard Nixon was facing impeachment when he resigned from office. 
- A small number of judges over the years have been removed through the impeachment process because of serious wrongdoing. The impeachment process is one of the major checks that Congress has on the other two branches of government.
- The Founding Fathers provided the president with the veto power as a defense against an aggressive Congress, but at the same time, that power is not complete because Congress can override a veto.
- The president and Congress share power in the area of military action. A president, as the commander in chief, can order the military into combat, but only Congress can issue a declaration of war against a foreign country. Congress passed the War Powers Act when President Nixon was still in office.
- The courts have the power to declare laws to be unconstitutional through the power of judicial review. They can also use judicial review to declare actions by the president or others in the executive branch to be unconstitutional.
- The judges and justices are protected by appointment during time of good behavior so that they cannot be threatened with being fired if they do not do what Congress or the president wants.
- Congress controls the jurisdiction of the courts (what kinds of cases they can hear).
- Congress can also change the size of the Supreme Court (although such an effort today would be considered very controversial).
- Congress can change the size and structure of the district and appellate courts.

## Key Terms
- **impeachment:** a process for removing government officials suspected of "high crimes and misdemeanors," including judges and even the president; requires a majority vote in the House of Representatives on articles of impeachment and then the support of two-thirds of the Senate for conviction and removal
- **executive orders:** a written order to a government agency issued by a president in the absence of congressional action to pursue a particular course of action; generally, such an order changes an existing law and can be challenged through the courts
