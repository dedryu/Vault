[[American Politics and the US Constitution (MOC)]]

## Introduction
Could you imagine what life would be like in the United States if every state was allowed to create its own currency? What if each state could decide if it wanted to engage in war with another country? Although it may be hard to imagine living under these conditions, this was how the U.S. government was formed under its first written constitution after declaring independence in 1776.  
  
In this module, you will review the first written constitution of the United States, known as the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. You will review the power structure that existed between the states and the national government under the Articles of Confederation. You will understand the power this document created, and its corresponding weaknesses, that ultimately paved the way for the [[Constitutional Convention]] that began in May 1787.

After reviewing the power structure in the United States under the Articles of Confederation, you will be able to describe the influence of competing **political ideologies** on the development of the United States government. These competing ideologies continue to be debated in the United States; specifically, people argue about whether the country needs a large national government or small national government with more power given to the states. These questions continue, especially in the current debates on healthcare and the legalization of marijuana.

## Becoming the United States

## Government under the Articles of Confederation
Waging a successful war against the [[United Kingdom]] required that the individual colonies, now sovereign states that often distrusted one another, form a unified nation with a central government capable of directing the country's defense. Gaining recognition and aid from foreign nations would also be easier if the new [[United States]] had a national government capable of borrowing money and negotiating treaties. So, the [[Second Continental Congress]], a meeting of **delegates** from the 13 colonies, asked its delegates to create a new government strong enough to win the country's independence but not so powerful that it would deprive people of the very liberties for which they were fighting.

The [[Articles of Confederation]] was the first attempt at forming the government of the United States. Although the U.S. had declared independence from British rule in 1776, the [[Declaration of Independence]] did not create any sort of structure for a new government.  
  
Americans wished their new government to be a republic in which the people, not a monarch, held power and elected representatives to govern. Many, however, feared that a nation as large as the United States could not be ruled effectively as a republic. Many also worried that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful. Thus, a confederation was created in which independent, self-governing states formed a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense.  
  
Fearful of replacing one tyrannical national government with another, however, the framers of the Articles of Confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by a weak central government. This structure ultimately proved to be dangerous and inefficient for the new country.  
  
In the following pages, you will review the structure of the national government under the Articles of Confederation, including the structure for Congress and the powers given to the national government. In understanding the structure of the national government under the Articles of Confederation, you will begin to see why it ultimately failed.

## Creating a New Government
Following the Declaration of Independence, each of the 13 states had drafted and ratified a constitution providing for a republican form of government in which political power rested in the hands of the people (although the right to vote was limited to free white men, and the property requirements for voting differed among the states). Each state had a governor and an elected legislature.  
  
In the new nation, the states remained free to govern their residents as they wished. The national government had authority to act in only a few areas, such as national defense, in which the states were assumed to have a common interest (and would have to supply soldiers). This arrangement was meant to prevent the national government from becoming too powerful or abusing the rights of individual citizens. In the careful balance between power for the national government and liberty for the states, the Articles of Confederation placed most of the power at the state level, thereby favoring the state governments over the national government.  
  
The congress that existed under the Articles of Confederation did not reflect the congress that exists today under the Constitution. Under the Articles of Confederation, there was a _unicameral_ congress, or one chamber known as the [[Confederation Congress]]. This is quite different from the current **bicameral legislature**, which has two chambers—the [[House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate]]. There were no executive or judicial branches like there are today. This one-chamber congress had very specific functions to make sure that the national government did not have too much power and that the power of the states remained protected.

Thus, powers given to the central government were severely limited. The Confederation Congress, formerly the Continental Congress, had the authority to:

- exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and Native peoples
- declare war
- coin currency and borrow money
- settle disputes between states.

Each state legislature appointed delegates to the Congress.

Regardless of its size or the number of delegates it chose to send, each state would have only one vote. Delegates could serve for no more than three consecutive years; this prevented a class of elite (upper class) professional politicians from developing. The nation would have no independent chief executive or judiciary. Nine votes were required before the central government could act, and the Articles of Confederation could be changed only by unanimous approval of all 13 states.

- **Articles of Confederation:** the first attempt at organizing the government of the United States, consisting of a unicameral (one-chamber) Congress; did not permit Congress to tax, regulate foreign or interstate commerce, or enforce its laws; failed as it formed an alliance of sovereign states with too weak a national government
- **delegates**: people given the authority to make decisions on the behalf of a group
- **bicameral legislature:** a legislative branch that consists of two separate chambers or two separately elected groups of officials, such as senators and representatives, like the Virginia Plan; bi, meaning "two," and camera, meaning "chamber," are Latin
